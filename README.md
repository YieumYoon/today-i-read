# Today-I-Read
Today-I-Read is a simple mobile friendly website that allows you to create sharable image to use on social media after reading a book on a daily basis. 

I tagreted instagram as the main platform to share the images. I use Millie(밀리의 서재)'s image creation page as a reference.

I used React as the main framework for the website. This is my first time using React, so I learned React as the project went on.
