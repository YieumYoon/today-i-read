# Today-I-Read ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/in%20progress-red)

Working on it... I will update this README file as I progress.
Current version is not working properly. 

Today-I-Read is a simple mobile friendly website that allows you to create sharable image to use on social media after reading a book on a daily basis. 

I tagreted instagram as the main platform to share the images. I use Millie(밀리의 서재)'s image creation page as a reference.

I used React as the main framework for the website. This is my first time using React, so I learned React as the project went on.

### Motivation
When I read the book, I wanted to share my reading progress on social media. However, I found it difficult to create a visually appealing image that reflects my reading progress. 밀리의 서재 has a feature that I wanted to use, so I used it as a reference. However, I could now use it if the book is not available on the platform. Therefore, I decided to create a website that has a similar feature. I hope this website will be useful for people who want to share their reading progress on social media.
